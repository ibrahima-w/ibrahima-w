## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a computer science student and a BreakThrough Tech fellow, learning machine learning and software engineering through hands-on projects. I use Python, pandas, and scikit-learn to clean data, build predictive models, and explore how technology can solve real-world problems. I'm also building my skills in writing clean code and developing applications. These experiences are helping me grow as a developer and explore how data and software can drive positive change.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning and working on prediction projects using Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning, data science, software engineering, and any tech-related projects that help me grow and improve my skills.
- âš¡ Fun fact:  I played lacrosse in high school and speak French fluently.
